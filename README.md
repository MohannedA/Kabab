# Kabab app 
iOS app that implements MVVM architecture, and design patterns such as Repository pattern. The app contains an implementation of QR Scanner and usage of third-party libraries such as RealmSwift and SnapKit

## IMPORTANT  Notes
* There are TODOs can be found written in the classes (some of them in the header comment). 
* MVVM is not fully implemented since Repository pattren not fully implemented.
* There are some classes or views which are unused but are there in case they are needed. 
* Final version of QR scanner is "QRScanner" (others are just old versions).
